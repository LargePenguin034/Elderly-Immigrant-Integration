# Project brief
As the number of immigrants arriving in Australia continues to rise each year, first-generation immigrants often seek to bring their aging parents to join them for a more secure and connected family life. Elderly immigrants face significant challenges adapting to their new environment due to limited English proficiency and few opportunities for integration through work, education, or business. Often, they experience loneliness and isolation after leaving their lives and friends behind in their home countries. The language barrier is the most critical factor affecting their integration. It stems not just from unfamiliarity with English but also from psychological factors affecting confidence in communication and challenges with culture, pronunciation, slang, and intonation. Addressing these issues can greatly enhance their independence, allowing them to confidently and safely engage in their new environment. This project aims to help elderly immigrant parents overcome communication challenges by allowing them to communicate and be understood in their native languages. This project should enhance their confidence and connection to achieve this goal by providing support that respects their pace.

# Problem space
Despite the availability of various support systems and services, a significant language barrier persists among elderly immigrant parents who do not speak English. This communication gap often leaves them unable to advocate for themselves, especially in critical situations such as healthcare, where effective communication is essential for their well-being. As a result, they become highly dependent on others for their needs, further exacerbating their sense of isolation and vulnerability. While translation tools like Google Translate exist, they often cause delays and may not be user-friendly for elderly individuals. There is a notable gap in technological solutions that provide seamless, real-time translation to facilitate smoother interactions, reduce social isolation, and enhance the overall well-being of elderly immigrant parents in multicultural settings.

# Success criteria
A real-time tool that actively and efficiently enhances communication for non-English-speaking individuals, accounting for cultural idiosyncrasies and colloquialisms, to facilitate their integration and independence.
